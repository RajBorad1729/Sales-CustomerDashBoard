As part of this project, I develop two Tableau dashboards to support stakeholders, including sales managers and executives, in analyzing sales performance and customer insights.

Sales Dashboard
This dashboard will provide a comprehensive view of key sales metrics and trends, enabling a year-over-year performance comparison. It will highlight revenue patterns, sales distribution, and other critical insights to support data-driven decision-making.

Customer Dashboard
Designed for marketing teams and management, this dashboard will present customer data, segmentation, and behavioral trends. It will offer actionable insights to enhance customer satisfaction, retention, and targeted marketing strategies.

These dashboards will be designed for clarity, interactivity, and ease of use, ensuring stakeholders can quickly derive meaningful insights.
